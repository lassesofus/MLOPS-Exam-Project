# Fake news detection 
==============================

### Description of the project

Following the intention of the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/overview) competition, we aim to build a system capable of classifying unreliable news articles.

### Framework 

We plan on using the [Huggingface Transformer](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) framework. We will be using a pre-trained model included in the framework.

### Data description

The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/data) is made available through the competition. This dataset contains the following features for each news article: A unique ID, the title, the author, the textual content, and finally a binary label of 0 or 1 corresponding to “reliable” and unreliable respectively. The model will be trained using DTU HPC.

### Models
We expect to use a transformer model made for Natural Language Processing - specifically a pre-trained BERT.
